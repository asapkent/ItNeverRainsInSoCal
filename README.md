# ItNeverRainsInSoCal
App gets current weather using users location.
This app uses https://openweathermap.org/api for weather data. 

To get weather data pp you will need to put in your own APIKey from openweathermap. The key can be added to APIClient file. 

I created this app to show ways to impliment swiftyJSON, alamoFire, Encodeable/Decodeable when making a simple GET request.
